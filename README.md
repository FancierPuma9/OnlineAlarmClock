# OnlineAlarmClock
Online Alarm Clock using ASP.NET


This project was done in order to gain knowledge of web-based applicaitons.
This is a web-version of a local Windows Form I built for alarms with math problems to solve.

Functions to be added:
  +Easier alarm time incrementing
  +Form validation to registration
  +Better CSS
  +Ability to provide math problem if user requests
  
  
  This was mainly a pilot for my C# and ASP.NET learning.
